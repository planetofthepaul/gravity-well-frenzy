Steps to Update and Redeploy
When you make changes to your game in Visual Studio Code and need to update the live version, follow these steps:

Make Your Changes

Open your project in Visual Studio Code
Make the necessary changes to your code


Save Your Changes

Make sure to save all modified files
Use Ctrl + S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + S (Mac) to save individual files
Or use Ctrl + K S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + K S (Mac) to save all files


Commit Your Changes

Open the Source Control view in VS Code (icon looks like a fork in the road)
You'll see a list of changed files
Enter a brief, descriptive commit message in the text box
Click the checkmark icon (âœ“) to commit the changes


Push Changes to GitHub

In the Source Control view, click on the '...' menu
Select 'Push' to send your changes to GitHub
Alternatively, you can click on the sync icon in the bottom left corner of VS Code


Deploy to GitHub Pages

Open a terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal)
Run the following command:
Copynpm run deploy

This command builds your app and pushes it to the gh-pages branch on GitHub


Verify the Deployment

Wait a few minutes for GitHub to process the update
Visit https://planetofthepaul.github.io/gravity-well-frenzy in your web browser
Refresh the page and check that your changes are live



Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors during the deploy process, make sure all your changes are committed and pushed to GitHub before trying npm run deploy again.
If your changes don't appear after deployment, try clearing your browser cache or opening the site in an incognito/private window.

Important Notes

Always test your changes locally using npm start before deploying.
Make meaningful commit messages to track your changes effectively.
If you make changes to package.json, run npm install before deploying.

Remember, every time you make changes and want them to go live, you need to commit, push, and then run npm run deploy.
